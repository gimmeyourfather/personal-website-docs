# Custom Button

Creating new buttons

### Editing title

To edit the title of the button, go to the input box with the text "Title" and change it to your liking. The button will automatically resize to your text.

### Editing link

To edit the link of the button, go to the input box with the text "Link" and change it to the link you want the button to go. You just need to put, for example, "youtube.com". We'll automatically put the https:// for you.
